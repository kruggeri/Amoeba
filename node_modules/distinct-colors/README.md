# Distinct Colors

This is a complete rewrite of (but is heavily inspired by) [Mathieu Jacomy's](https://github.com/jacomyma) [Palette Generator](https://github.com/medialab/iwanthue/blob/master/js/libs/chroma.palette-gen.js)

I have taken the ideas and the theories, and put them into a simple modular library. I have also optimized it for speed.

This library generates a palette of *visually* distinct colors, and returns an array of [chroma-js](https://github.com/gka/chroma.js) objects.

distinct-colors is highly configurable:

- Choose how many colors are in the palette
- Restrict the hue to a specific range
- Restrict the chroma (saturation) to a specific range
- Restrict the lightness to a specific range
- Configure general quality of the palette
